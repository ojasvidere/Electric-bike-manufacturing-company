An electric bike manufacturing company is considering an $8M investment to add a new production line for electric skateboards. They are exploring machine options and funding sources, selecting from Loan, Common Stocks, Preferred Stocks, and Retained Earnings, with at least two needed to secure capital. The machines have no salvage value after a 10-year period, and the company expects rapid growth following the expansion. The primary question is whether the project is economically viable.
